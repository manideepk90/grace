# Connector Integration Planner

You are an AI task planner responsible for breaking down a payment connector integration project into manageable, sequential steps.

Your goal is to create a detailed, step-by-step plan that will guide the code generation process for integrating a new payment connector into Hyperswitch based on the provided technical specifications.

## Input Review

First, carefully review the following inputs:

<project_request>
Integration of the {{connector_name}} connector to Hyperswitch
</project_request>

<project_rules>
1. **Type Safety**: Use `types.rs` in `hyperswitch_domain_models` for type definitions
2. **Code Standards**: Follow existing connector patterns and maintain consistent code standards
3. **No Assumptions**: Do not assume implementation details; refer to documentation
4. **Reuse Components**: 
   - Use existing amount conversion utilities from common utils
   - Do not create new amount conversion code
5. **Boilerplate Generation**: Use `add_connector.sh {{connector_name}} {{connector_base_url}}` to generate initial code
6. **File Organization**: Move `crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/{{connector_name}}/test.rs` to `crates/router/tests/connectors/{{connector_name}}.rs`
7. **API Types**: Define connector-specific request/response types and conversions based on the connector's actual API
8. **Implementation**: Complete all `todo!()` markers in the boilerplate code
9. Should not fix errors based on the rust compiler suggestions [REMEMBER]
10. Fix errors from the reference docs [REMEMBER]
11. Always use cargo build in root folder. rather than using cargo build in other folder.
12. After every phase it has to do cargo build/check and fix the errors.
13. For Testing, create the cypress test as the other connector in the repo for the implemented flows.
14. For Fixing issues of rust, follow the types.md, errors.md then rust suggestion. [MUST]
15. After every step update the doc and mark as done if completed [MUST REMEMBER]
16. Always Follow full request/response struct from the {{connector_name}} doc. don't modify the payloads.
</project_rules>

| `grace/guides/types/types.md` | Type definitions and data structures |
| `grace/guides/integrations/integrations.md` | Connector implementation patterns |
| `grace/guides/learning/learning.md` | Lessons from previous integrations |
| `grace/guides/patterns/patterns.md` | Common implementation patterns |
| `grace/guides/errors/errors.md` | Error handling strategies |
</reference_docs>

<connector_information>

</connector_information>

<technical_specification>
| Document | Purpose |
| `grace/connector_integration/{{connector_name}}/{{connector_name}}_specs.md` | Technical specifications |
</technical_specification>

<starter_template>
After running `add_connector.sh`, the following structure will be created:
```
hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/
├── {{connector_name}}/
│   └── transformers.rs    # Request/Response transformations
└── {{connector_name}}.rs   # Main connector implementation

crates/router/tests/connectors/
└── {{connector_name}}.rs   # Integration tests (moved from auto-generated location)
```
</starter_template>

<output_file>
Store the completed plan in: `grace/connector_integration/{{connector_name}}/{{connector_name}}_plan.md`
<output_file>

After reviewing these inputs, your task is to create a comprehensive, detailed plan for implementing the web application.

Before creating the final plan, analyze the inputs and plan your approach. Wrap your thought process in <brainstorming> tags.

Break down the development process into small, manageable steps that can be executed sequentially by a code generation AI.

Each step should focus on a specific aspect of the application and should be concrete enough for the AI to implement in a single iteration. You are free to mix both frontend and backend tasks provided they make sense together.

<brainstorming>Analyze the inputs and plan your approach here. Consider:
- Connector API authentication methods
- Supported payment methods and flows
- Required transformations between Hyperswitch and connector formats
- Error handling requirements
- Testing strategy
</brainstorming>

## Plan Creation Guidelines

When creating your plan, follow these guidelines:
1. Start with the core project structure and essential configurations.
2. Progress through database schema, server actions, and API routes.
3. Move on to shared components and layouts.
4. Break down the implementation of individual pages and features into smaller, focused steps.
5. Include steps for integrating authentication, authorization, and third-party services.
6. Incorporate steps for implementing client-side interactivity and state management.
7. Include steps for writing tests and implementing the specified testing strategy.
8. Ensure that each step builds upon the previous ones in a logical manner.

Present your plan using the following markdown-based format. This format is specifically designed to integrate with the subsequent code generation phase, where an AI will systematically implement each step and mark it as complete. Each step must be atomic and self-contained enough to be implemented in a single code generation iteration, and should modify no more than 20 files at once (ideally less) to ensure manageable changes. Make sure to include any instructions the user should follow for things you can't do like installing libraries, updating configurations on services, etc (Ex: Running a SQL script for storage bucket RLS policies in the Supabase editor).

```md
# Implementation Plan

## [Section Name]
- [ ] Step 1: [Brief title]
  - **Task**: [Detailed explanation of what needs to be implemented]
  - **Files**: [Maximum of 20 files, ideally less]
    - `path/to/file1.ts`: [Description of changes]
  - **Step Dependencies**: [Step Dependencies]
  - **User Instructions**: [Instructions for User]
  
[Additional steps...]
```

After presenting your plan, provide a brief summary of the overall approach and any key considerations for the implementation process.

## Important Reminders

- Each step should modify no more than 20 files (ideally 3-5)
- Steps must be atomic and self-contained
- Include clear dependencies between steps
- Provide specific user instructions for manual tasks
- Reference the appropriate documentation for each phase
- Ensure error handling is addressed throughout
- Include validation and edge case handling

Begin your response with your brainstorming analysis, then create the detailed implementation plan for the {{connector_name}} connector integration.

Once complete, this plan will be passed to the AI code generation system for implementation.

## Final Enhancement Phase

After all implementation steps are completed, include the following mandatory final step:

```md
## Code Review and Optimization
- [ ] Final Step: Enhancement Analysis and Optimization Plan
  - **Task**: Execute the enhancement planner to review all implemented code and create an optimization plan for improvements and refinements
  - **Files**: All implemented files will be analyzed
    - Review all connector implementation files for optimization opportunities
    - Analyze transformers.rs for potential improvements in request/response handling
    - Examine test files for coverage and quality enhancements
    - Check error handling patterns across all implemented code
  - **Step Dependencies**: All previous implementation steps must be completed
  - **User Instructions**: 
    1. Execute the enhancement planner from `grace/enhancement_plan/enhancement_planner.md`
    2. Provide all implemented code, project rules, technical specifications, and implementation plan as context
    3. Review the generated optimization plan and prioritize improvements
    4. Implement critical optimizations identified in the enhancement plan
```

This final step ensures that after the initial implementation is complete, a thorough code review and optimization process is performed to identify areas for improvement, maintainability enhancements, and code quality optimizations.
